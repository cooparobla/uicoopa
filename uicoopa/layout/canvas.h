/**
 * @class CanvasComponent
 * @brief Screen- or world-space root of a UI tree, driving the measure/arrange/emit rebuild.
 *
 * coopa::scene::SceneObject::update() is a pre-order depth-first walk over
 * components, which happens to visit parents before children — but layout
 * groups need a bottom-up measure pass before the top-down arrange pass, an
 * ordering plain pre-order traversal cannot express. CanvasComponent works
 * around this not by avoiding SceneObject's lifecycle, but by doing its own
 * internal multi-pass recursion (measure_/arrange_/emit_ below) from
 * late_update() rather than update() — Scene::update() runs first across the
 * WHOLE scene (e.g. Button's hover/press color fade), then Scene::late_update()
 * runs second (this canvas's layout+emit), so emitted geometry always reflects
 * this frame's already-updated state instead of trailing it by one frame. See
 * coopa::scene::Component::late_update()'s doc for the general rationale.
 *
 * A loaded Scene needs nothing beyond this to be a live UI scene:
 * @code
 * scene_mgr.load_scene(path);   // Scene::start() already ran
 * // once per frame, per canvas (usually exactly one):
 * canvas->set_viewport(screen_w, screen_h);
 * canvas->set_input(window.input());
 * scene_mgr.update(dt);         // Button color fade, any other component behavior
 * scene_mgr.get_active_scene().late_update(dt);  // this canvas's layout + emit + input dispatch
 * ui_pass.draw(cmd, frame, screen_w, screen_h, canvas->scale_factor(), canvas->draw_list());
 * @endcode
 *
 * rebuild_layout()/rebuild_emit() remain public and independently callable —
 * rebuild_layout() is pure layout math (no DrawList, no GPU type), still safe
 * to exercise from a headless unit test with no window/device/EventSystem
 * involved at all.
