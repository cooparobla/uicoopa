/**
 * @file ui_world_pass.h
 * @brief Draws a WorldSpace CanvasComponent's DrawList as real 3D geometry, inside a render
 *        pass the host already opened.
 *
 * The world-space sibling of ui_pass.h, and deliberately almost the same file: both wrap
 * gfxcoopa's TexturedQuad2DPass (engine/passes/textured_quad_2d_pass.h) for the descriptor
 * layout/pool, the TextureView->DescriptorSet cache, the per-frame-in-flight streaming
 * vertex/index buffers, and the pipeline-variant machinery. Only three things genuinely
 * differ, and they are all this file owns:
 *
 *  1. The push block is a full `proj * view * CanvasComponent::model()` matrix instead of a
 *     2D scale/offset pair, so it needs its own vertex shader (ui_world.vert -- see that
 *     file for why gfx_quad_2d_transform() cannot be reused).
 *  2. Clip rects become scissors by PROJECTING the rect's corners, not by scaling them.
 *  3. Occlusion: a host-supplied scene depth texture at set 1, compared per fragment.
 *
 * Nothing about the UI itself changes. UiVertex is still 2D canvas pixels, DrawList still
 * batches by (texture, clip, z_order), and every widget still emits exactly what it always
 * did -- which is the whole point: a world canvas hosts the entire widget library for free.
 *
 * One rule UiPass does NOT have: begin_frame() must precede the frame's draw() calls.
 * TexturedQuad2DPass owns ONE streaming vertex/index buffer pair per frame-in-flight, and a
 * scene can hold many world canvases -- so, unlike the single screen-space canvas UiPass
 * usually serves, draw() cannot simply overwrite that buffer. It APPENDS at a running cursor
 * that begin_frame() resets, and begin_frame() is also where the buffers are grown to the
 * whole frame's total (growing mid-frame would reallocate out from under geometry already
 * uploaded and already referenced by recorded draw commands).
 *
 * Same two ordering rules as UiPass, for the same reasons:
 *  - register_textures() must run BEFORE the host's Renderer::begin_frame(), because
 *    DescriptorSet::bind_image() updates descriptor sets immediately, which is unsafe once
 *    a render pass has begun. draw() only ever looks up already-registered sets.
 *  - draw() is a GUEST inside a render pass the host already opened. gfxcoopa's
 *    pipeline::RenderPass always clears its colour attachment on load, so opening a second
 *    pass over the same image would erase the 3D scene underneath the UI.
