/**
 * @file text_atlas_registry.h
 * @brief Process-wide record of every R8 glyph-atlas TextureView that exists.
 *
 * A UI pass has to know which of its bound textures are R8 coverage atlases rather than RGBA
 * sprites, so it can select the "text" pipeline variant for them -- get it wrong and a glyph
 * atlas's coverage values are drawn as colour, i.e. solid blocks instead of letters (see
 * UiPass::is_text_view_).
 *
 * That knowledge used to be assembled at SCENE-PARSE time: UIResourceCache recorded each
 * `(font, authored font_size)` pair a !Text component asked for, and mark_text_atlases()
 * replayed the list. That works only while the baked size is exactly the authored size. It is
 * not, any more -- Text bakes at `font_size * the canvas's effective text scale`, so the size
 * is a runtime property of the window and the canvas, and a parse-time list cannot know it.
 *
 * So registration moved to the one place that cannot be out of date: FontAtlas's constructor.
 * Every atlas that exists is in here, whoever created it and whenever; the destructor removes
 * it again. Hosts call UIResourceCache::mark_text_atlases() per frame exactly as before.
 *
 * Not thread-safe, and deliberately so -- atlas creation happens on the thread that emits UI,
 * which is the same thread that records draw commands.
